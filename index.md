# Welcome to my travel blog

I've finally completed my first travel blog which was prompted by your interests of my recent 3-weeks travel in Europe. My wife & 2 kids have been travelling with me since the kids were in primary school and up to now that they are already in the workforce. We share the same love of good food, musicals & hectic travel itinerairies. We've experienced how travel have changed throughout the years like GPS replacing the folding road maps, Google maps almost giving all the travel information you need, accommodations not restricted to hotels anymore and being able to connect to freelance/convenient travel faciltators like walking tours, cashless public transports, ultra-cheap budget airlines and a variety of social media connections to various providers & communities. The most important & absolutely necessary travel tool that facilitates all this DIY travel is of course the...smartphone (so please guard it with your life while travelling).  

## Here are the highlights of our recent travel to Europe. I hope you'll enjoy the sights & my side comments & tips.
