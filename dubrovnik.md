# Dubrovnik

The Paris 2024 Olympics featured an exciting opening ceremony with athletes parading on boats along the Seine River. The Games feature over 300 events, including swimming, basketball, tennis, gymnastics, and track. Notable athletes include Leon Marchand, Teddy Riner, Simone Biles, and Katie Ledecky. The Australian team excelled in various events, with notable achievements in swimming, athletics, and cycling.

## The wet & long opening ceremony

What's unique with the opening ceremony is it was done along the Seine river where the athletes are on boats passing by. The problem is because of too many moving parts, the only way to maintain the script or story line is through the big screens.
> Australia & France teams passing our location where we were standing for 5 hours, wet with loud speakers & a distant big screen. It was a different kind of experience compared to Sydney 2000.
