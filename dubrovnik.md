# Dubrovnik

Dubrovnik, often called the “Pearl of the Adriatic,” is a stunning city located on the southern coast of Croatia along the Adriatic Sea. Known for its well-preserved medieval architecture and fortified old town, Dubrovnik is a UNESCO World Heritage.


## The stunning old town

Dubrovnik’s old town is famous for its beautiful churches, palaces, and the impressive city walls that offer breathtaking views of the sea.
> It’s also known for being a filming location for the TV series “Game of Thrones,” where it represented the fictional city of King’s Landing. It is a "must" to walk around the wall of the city and the following photos I got shows how beautiful this place is. Note that the first photo is a map showing the walls around the city, where we walked under a 35C sun!

> The map also shows when Dubrovnik experienced a significant and tragic event known as the Siege of Dubrovnik. This was part of the Croatian War of Independence. The siege began on October 1, 1991, when the Yugoslav People’s Army (JNA) launched an attack on the city. The siege lasted until May 31, 1992 but not after the city suffered extensive damage due to heavy shelling by the JNA. The bombardment of the Old Town on December 6, 1991, was particularly devastating and drew international condemnation1. The siege resulted in significant loss of life, with 194 Croatian military personnel and 82-88 civilians killed.

## The famous stairs of the "walk of shame"

> It's amazing how cinematography can transform this place in the "Game of Thrones" 8 seasons. I still don't like how the series ended, it looks like it was rushed & too abrupt.

## We enjoyed the very fresh seafood 

> The heat has caused me to lose my appetite but this restaurant was air conditioned so I really enjoyed it.
