# Dubrovnik

Dubrovnik, often called the “Pearl of the Adriatic,” is a stunning city located on the southern coast of Croatia along the Adriatic Sea. Known for its well-preserved medieval architecture and fortified old town, Dubrovnik is a UNESCO World Heritage.


## The stunning old town

Dubrovnik’s old town is famous for its beautiful churches, palaces, and the impressive city walls that offer breathtaking views of the sea.
> It’s also known for being a filming location for the TV series “Game of Thrones,” where it represented the fictional city of King’s Landing. It is a "must" that walk around the wall of the city and the following photos I got shows how beautiful this place is.
