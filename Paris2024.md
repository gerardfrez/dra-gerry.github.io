# Paris 2024 Olympics

The Paris 2024 Olympics featured an exciting opening ceremony with athletes parading on boats along the Seine River. The Games feature over 300 events, including swimming, basketball, tennis, gymnastics, and track. The Australian team excelled in various events, with notable achievements in swimming, athletics, and cycling.

## The wet & long opening ceremony

What's unique with the opening ceremony is that it was not done in a stadium but along the Seine river where the athletes are on boats passing by. The problem is because of too many moving parts, the only way to maintain the script or story line is through the big screens.
> Australia & France teams passing our location where we were standing for 5 hours, we were wet and near loud speakers but a distant big screen. It was a different kind of experience but I still prefer in a seated & controlled venue like during our Sydney 2000.

## Where's Lady Gaga?

The show is a consolidation of live, pre-recorded acts as well as multimedia sequenced to show France's culture, fashion & lifestyle which was smartly connected & presented in big screens along the river.
> These stairs near where we were was empty when Gaga was singing & dancing on them in the big screens, so it was pre-recorded :(

## Events we watched

Overall the olympics was organised but there were not many volunteers compared to Sydney. The French also love their language so much there were no subtitles in the pre-opening talks and not easy to communicate in english.
> The beach volleyball's venue was right beside the Tower, while the badminton & hockey needs to travel by trains to go to the venues

## The different moods of the Tower
> The Eiffel tower in all its glory

## The flying cauldron
> The cauldron does not really have fire but incorporates 40 LED spotlights to illuminate the cloud created by 200 high-pressure misting nozzles. Paris is really living up to it's name as the host of the climate agreement.
