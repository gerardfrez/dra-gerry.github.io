## The wet & long opening ceremony

My photo of a beautiful sunset and just in time for my fav cruise ship Celebrity X (I did a cruise in Scandinavia & Asia in it and  I will so do a blog soon). Santorini is full of outdoor setting clubs which showcase the sunsets and I took this from one of them. Every golden hour ie. 8:20pm for this photo,  the sunset is always different every time.
> TIP: Avoid the popular sunset lookout. Recommendation is to go to a restaurant for a few drinks before the sunset
