## Stunning sunset

> My photo of a beautiful sunset and just in time for my fav cruise ship X Celebrity (did a cruise in Scandinavia & Asia which I will so a blog soon). 
> Santorini is full of outdoor setting clubs and I took this in one of them.

## White-washed building with blue domes

> Buildings are painted using limestone that is why they look pristine white.
> There are really not many blue domes as shown in the photos below.
> These places are full of people especially during sunset.
