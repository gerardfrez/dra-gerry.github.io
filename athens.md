## Parthenon on the Acropolis

What's unique with the opening ceremony is it was done along the Seine river where the athletes are on boats passing by. The problem is because of too many moving parts, the only way to maintain the script or story line is through the big screens.
> Australia & France teams passing our location where we were standing for 5 hours, wet with loud speakers & a distant big screen. It was a different kind of experience compared to Sydney 2000.
